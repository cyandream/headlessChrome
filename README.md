Automated testing with Headless Chrome, Karma as a runner and Mocha+Chai for authoring tests


Karma, Mocha, Chai, Headless Chrome

Karma is a testing harness that works with any of the the most popular testing frameworks (Jasmine, Mocha, QUnit).

Chai is an assertion library that works with Node and in the browser. We need the latter.

Headless Chrome is a way to run the Chrome browser in a headless environment without the full browser UI. One of the benefits of using Headless Chrome (as opposed to testing directly in Node) is that your JavaScript tests will be executed in the same environment as users of your site. Headless Chrome gives you a real browser context without the memory overhead of running a full version of Chrome.
